Game-Guess_the_number
  This is a simple number guessing game. First the user is asked to enter a upper limit number, so that random number is generated in the range between 0 and the entered upper limit number. Then the user is asked to guess the number. For each of the guess made by the user, a clue is given to the user stating if the random number generated is greater than or less than the guessed number until the user guesses the generated random number right. Program also includes the number of guesses made to guess it right.
